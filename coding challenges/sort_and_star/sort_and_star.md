## Sort and Star

Link: https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cfdf34902f6ba3d300001e

You will be given a vector of strings. You must sort it alphabetically (case-sensitive, and based on the ASCII values of the chars) and then return the first value.

The returned value must be a string, and have "\*\*\*" between each of its letters.

You should not remove or add elements from/to the array.

## Examples

```
two_sort(&["bitcoin", "take", "over", "the", "world", "maybe", "who", "knows", "perhaps"])

Output: "b***i***t***c***o***i***n"
```

```
two_sort(&["turns", "out", "random", "test", "cases", "are", "easier", "than", "writing", "out", "basic", "ones"])

Output:  "a***r***e";

```
